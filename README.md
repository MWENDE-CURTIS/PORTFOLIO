Valery Mwende Mwiti - Personal Portfolio
This repository hosts the source code for Valery Mwende Mwiti's personal portfolio website. It is a clean, modern, and responsive one-page site designed to showcase my professional journey, skills, projects, and contact information.

üåü Features
Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

Elegant & Engaging UI: A unique, dark-themed design with subtle animations and floating particle effects creates a polished and memorable user experience.

Sections: The portfolio is organized into distinct sections:

Intro: A narrative-driven introduction to my story and mission.

About Me: A personal touch with photos and a summary of my journey.

Education & Certifications: A clear overview of my academic and professional foundations.

Skills & Interests: A list of my technical skills and personal interests.

Work Experience: A timeline of my professional journey.

Projects: A showcase of my key projects, including assistive technology solutions.

Contact Me: A form for direct communication and social media links.

###Asynchronous Contact Form: Not yet responsive - will configure Javascript later in the process

Downloadable CV: A prominent button allows visitors to easily download my professional resume.

üí° Implementation Strategy and Workflow
This project was developed through a collaborative and iterative process, focusing on a robust and functional end product. The workflow can be broken down into the following key stages:

Initial Requirements & Persona Definition: The project began with mapping out who "Valery Mwende Mwiti" is. This included defining my professional background, key skills (Computer Science, Marine Engineering, assistive technology), and the core content to be displayed.

Content & Structure Generation: Based on the requirements, a comprehensive, self-contained HTML file was generated. This initial version included all the necessary sections, placeholder content, and a clean, responsive layout using custom CSS to create a cohesive brand identity. Key visual assets (logo.jpg, image1.jpg, image2.jpg, valery_mwende_mwiti_cv.pdf) were integrated as local files.

Iterative Refinement and Placeholder Management: I worked identified and managed placeholders within the code. This involved:

Identifying specific lines where images, CV files, and project links needed to be updated.

Providing detailed instructions on what each placeholder represented (e.g., PLACEHOLDER_GITHUB_URL_SENSI).

Explaining the purpose of the form submission URL (PLACEHOLDER_FORM_SUBMISSION_URL) and suggesting third-party services like Formspree to handle submissions without a custom backend.

###Functional Enhancement (Asynchronous Form): I want to avoid the default form redirect, which will lead to a key functional upgrade. The contact form's behavior will be modified using JavaScript to:

#Intercept the form's default submission event.

#Use the Fetch API to submit the form data asynchronously.

#Display a success or error message directly on the page, providing instant feedback without a page reload.

Documentation (This README): The final step in the development process is the creation of this README.md file. Its purpose is to serve as comprehensive project documentation, detailing the project's purpose, features, technologies, and the entire implementation strategy from a collaborative perspective.

Deployment & Hosting: The project is now ready to be pushed to a version control service like GitHub. It can then be easily deployed to a static site hosting service such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, which will make the portfolio publicly accessible.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the website.

CSS3: Custom styles for a polished, modern, and responsive user interface.

##Will configure JavaScript (ES6+): To handle the asynchronous form submission and other interactive elements.

Font Awesome: For icons used in the projects, social media links, and other sections.

Google Fonts (Inter): For a clean and professional typography.
